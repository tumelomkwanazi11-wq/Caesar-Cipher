# Caesar-Cipher
Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption system using Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of cryptography, where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

The program allows users to both encrypt and decrypt text by specifying a shift value. It includes input validation to ensure that the shift value is within a valid range and demonstrates how text transformation can be automated using Python’s built-in string translation methods.

This project was created as part of my learning journey in software development to strengthen my understanding of functions, string manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving.

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

To understand basic cryptography concepts

To practice function design and parameter handling

To implement encryption and decryption logic

To use Python string methods such as maketrans() and translate()

To apply input validation techniques

To improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills

⚙️ How It Works

The system works by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

Encryption Process

The user provides text and a shift value.

The alphabet is shifted according to the given value.

A translation table is created.

The original text is converted into encrypted text.

Decryption Process

The encrypted text is provided along with the same shift value.

The shift direction is reversed.

The original message is restored.

The program supports both lowercase and uppercase letters while keeping non-alphabet characters unchanged.
